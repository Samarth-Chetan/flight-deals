# âœˆ Flight Deal Tracker

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a **Flight Deal Tracker** that automatically searches for cheap flights from a fixed origin city (Boston by default) to a list of destinations stored in a Google Sheet.  
If it finds a price lower than your target price, it sends **WhatsApp** and **email alerts** to all subscribed users.

The system integrates with:
- **Google Sheets** via the Sheety API (to store destinations, target prices, and customer emails)
- **Amadeus API** (to search for flights)
- **Twilio API** (to send WhatsApp messages)
- **SMTP** (to send email notifications)

---

## âš™ Features
- Fetch destination data and target prices from a Google Sheet.
- Automatically update missing IATA airport codes.
- Search for flights within a given date range (direct and indirect).
- Find the **cheapest available flight** for each destination.
- Send alerts to customers via:
  - **WhatsApp** (Twilio)
  - **Email** (SMTP)
